# Android Playground

A place to integrate, test, and demonstrate various things. See the [project's code documentation](https://jjerrell.github.io/AndroidPlaygroundPages/).

## Logging

Demonstrates various ways to log messages using the standard library in a Jetpack Compose MVVM architecture.

For best results, use filter: `package:dev.jjerrell.android.logging tag:LoggingPage tag:MAIN_ACTIVITY` to get rid of the background noise.

## Firebase

To use or preview any Firebase implementations, you'll need to add your own google-services.json file to the root of the app module.
